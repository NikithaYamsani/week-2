# ðŸŒ± Organic Waste to Fertilizer (AI/ML Project)

### ðŸ“Œ Description
Part of **AICTE EduNet AI/ML Upskilling Program** under **Sustainable Agriculture**.  
Goal: Predict **fertilizer yield** from organic waste features (type, moisture, pH, temperature, C/N ratio, composting time).

## ðŸš€ Progress

### Week 1 (30%)
- Created synthetic dataset.  
- Preprocessing: handled missing values, scaled numeric features, encoded categories.  

### Week 2 (60%)
- Trained models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
- Evaluated using RÂ², MSE, MAE, Accuracy.  

| Model              | RÂ²   | MSE   | MAE  | Accuracy |
|--------------------|------|-------|------|----------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.50 | 36.32 | 5.10 | 0.78     |
| Random Forest      | 0.41 | 42.97 | 5.39 | 0.76     |
| Gradient Boosting  | 0.41 | 42.86 | 5.41 | 0.76     |

âœ… **Best Model: Linear Regression** (highest RÂ², lowest error).

## ðŸ”§ Improvisations
- Built custom dataset.  
- Added preprocessing pipeline.  
- Defined custom regression accuracy.  
- Compared multiple ML models.
